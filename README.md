# PANS: PROS Anti-Nuisance Systems
PANS is a code library for PROS that aims to simplify some difficult tasks by creating easy-to-use utilities.

This system is built using the Purdue Robotics Operating System (PROS) for V5, and thus can only be used in that environment.  This library will not work with legacy, Cortex-Based control systems.

PANS is completely open source, so anyone can use, modify, and distribute this code.
